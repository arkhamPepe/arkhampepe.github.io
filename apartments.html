      <h3>Estepona Paradise</h3>
      <p class="apartment-p">
          This grand white summer house is situated solitarily and in the center on the island in tranquil
          and naturaally beautiful surroundings. Thankfully, due to the amazing location på on a small slope
          one will experience a view out of the ordinary from all of the estate. The house itself is an ancient
          mallorcian kingdom, where one blends good comfort with old traditions.
          The great swimming pool lies directly in front of the house and the terraces along with
          being surrounded by a neatly trimmed and well taken cared of garden. Other upper planes are not decorated for living,
          but still offers a big room with a ping pong table. The small village of Petra sure
          is a nice excursion.
